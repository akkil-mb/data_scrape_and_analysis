  "description": "From thundering timpani, to the melodic sound of a guitar, the impressive singing voice of your favorite artist, or the beat of electronic dance music, nothing creates drama like powerful bass. Ideal for music lovers, the non-fatiguing, high-end HD 660S2 now delivers even more impact and emotion. Our engineers optimized the HD 660S's surround, transducer airflow, and coil to double the sound pressure at the lowest octaves. You can feel the lowest note on the piano (27.5 Hz) or the kick of the bass drum (45-60 Hz) as if you were there at the recording studio, allowing you to pick out individual instruments and discover new sonic details. The relaxed sound and open-black design make it an extremely comfortable headphone that is also suitable for long listening sessions. The headphone's warm, relaxed sound is reflected in its timeless design and elegant bronze accents. With warm tuning, smooth treble and strong bass, the standard-setter for extended listening is now also the standard for extended bass.",

  "description": "Boost your cell signal in your home with the SureCall Flare 3.0 The SureCall Flare 3.0 4G booster kit is an easy-to-use cell phone signal booster for home. It boosts 4G, LTE, and 3G signal speed for all carriers and phones. Bundled with a powerful yagi directional antenna, you get an extra 9 dB of gain compared to the normal Flare. The Surecall Flare 3.0 cellular signal booster combines the booster and indoor antenna to streamline the system's design for easier installation and an attractive, low-profile appearance. The stylish one-piece base unit is designed to be placed on an open tabletop or shelf for clearer and more reliable voice and data performance. The two pieces are connected via the included 50ft premium RG-6 coaxial cable. Kit includes a yagi directional antenna that reaches distant cell towers. The Flare 3.0 4G signal booster uses a yagi directional antenna to provide more gain to your amplifier. With strong outside signal, you can expect up to 3,000 sq ft of indoor coverage. With weaker outside signal, that coverage may decrease to around 1500 sq ft. The Surecall Flare 3.0 cell phone signal repeater works with all carriers in the United States and Canada: AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint, Straight Talk, Trackphone and U.S. Cellular. Get your Flare 3.0 cellular booster today for the most stylish, simplest solution to solve your poor signal issues.",
  "features": [
    "PRODUCT FEATURES— The SureCall Flare 3.0 cell phone signal amplifier boosts weak signal in 2-4 rooms, up to 3500 sq ft inside any home or office. This results in fewer dropped calls, improved battery life, higher audio quality, and faster data and streaming for AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint, Straight Talk, U.S. Cellular and many more. Flare 3.0 boosts 5G/4G LTE voice, text and data signals for all North American cell carriers, including Verizon’s 5G Nationwide data signals..Maximum Gain: 72 dB",
    "COVERAGE AREA— The indoor coverage area that the Flare 3.0 creates varies based on existing signal at the exterior antenna location: 1-2 bars outside ~ 1500 sq ft inside, 3-4 bars ~ 2500 sq ft, 5 bars ~ 3500 sq ft. If there is weak signal where the exterior antenna is installed, we recommend a booster kit that includes components to capture and broadcast a stronger signal, like the Fusion4Home Max. If there is no available signal to boost at the exterior antenna location, a signal booster will not work.",
    "BEST PERFORMANCE— Finding a location with consistent signal that the Yagi antenna can capture is important and will improve performance. Indoor coverage area is directly related to the existing signal strength available at the exterior antenna location. For best performance we recommend a minimum 30 feet of horizontal separation between the base station and exterior antenna. Without this separation performance will suffer and the coverage area will be reduced. 2XP technology delivers 2x uplink power for best performance in remote areas",
    "EASY INSTALL— Simply set up the Yagi outdoor antenna, run the cable into your home, and place the cellular amplifier (base unit) where you want. Other boosters require you to run cables or drill holes to install the indoor antenna, but not the Flare 3.0 - it has the indoor antenna integrated to the amplifier. Resembling a speaker, Flare 3.0 fits right in to any modern room living room, bedroom, or office. Place It wherever in your building you need improved cellular signal and the amplifier will automatically boost your signal.",
    "BUILT TO LAST— Designed and tested in the USA with the high-quality components for longevity and connectivity where you need it most. Includes industry best 3-year warranty and lifetime US-based tech support. FCC approved signal boosters. SureCall is proudly American owned and operated– US company based in Silicon Valley California. SureCall is an Authorized Verizon 5G Signal Booster Vendor."

    "Hi-Res Audio Certified: Custom oversized 40 mm dynamic drivers produce Hi-Res Audio—a certification only awarded to audio devices capable of producing exceptional sound. Life Q20 reproduces your music with extended high frequencies that reach up to 40 kHz for extraordinary clarity and detail. <br>",
    "Reduce Ambient Noises By Up to 90%: Our team of engineers conducted more than 100000 tests in real-life scenarios to fine-tune Life Q20's 4 built-in ANC microphones and digital ANC algorithm. As a result, the hybrid active noise cancellation can detect and cancel out a wider range of low and mid-frequency noises such as cars and airplane engines. <br>",
    "100% Stronger Bass: Our exclusive BassUp technology conducts real-time analysis of the low frequencies to instantly strengthen the bass output. Double press the play button when listening to bass-heavy genres like EDM and hip-hop for an amplified listening experience. <br>",
    "40-Hour Playtime: Up to 40 hours of non-stop playtime in wireless ANC mode (at 60% volume) is extended to an enormous 60 hours in standard music mode. A single charge gives you enough juice to listen to over 600 songs or soundtrack multiple long haul flights. And when you're in a rush, charge for 5 minutes for 4 hours of listening. <br>",
    "Universal Comfort: Memory foam earcups gently mold around your ears, while the headband's rotating joints automatically adjust the angle of the earcups to fit the shape of your head. This ensures that Life Q20 wireless headphones deliver maximum comfortable and a secure seal."
